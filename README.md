I could train a 1B-A200m model on an iPhone 17 Pro at ~650 tokens/sec. 
It will take 360 days on 20B tokens of training data and use 156KW of electricity which cost $51. 

The phone will fry of course, so I wrote algorithms to run inference on your phone rather. 
We named it after a plant that survives in resource-constrained environments, the Cactus. 

[![cactus](https://img.shields.io/badge/cactus-000000?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/cactus-compute/cactus) can run similar model on your Grandma’s Pixel 6a at 36 tokens/second 
while only draining 10% battery per hour of continuous inference and using 250MB RAM only.  

Cactus launched July 2025, grew to 4k GitHub stars and completed 10m inference tasks across 900+ projects in 2025. 

Cactus raised funding in Aug 2025 from YCombinator, FCVC (portfolio include Slack, Coinbase, GitLab, Instacart etc.), 
Oxford, 6 smaller funds like Transpose (run by Garry Tan's brother).

Besides VCs, Cactus also received checks from fellow YC founders, as well as 
62 tech CTOs/VP/Directors both via syndicate and directly at Google DeepMind etc. 

We have now grown to 8 exceptionally gifted MTS from UCLA, Nokia, Google, Stanford, Oxford. 
The project is now also maintaiained by UCLA's BruinAI, UWaterloo's WatAI, Yale's YAA, NUS's SCAIS and more! 

Follow the journey!

### Career Progression 
- **2025-XX:** Cactus (YC S25) - Founder & CTO (tiny inference engine for phones and wearables).
- **2024-25:** Deep Render - AI Research Engineer (realtime video models that run on phone GPU/NPU).
- **2021-24:** Wisdm - ML Software Engineer (distributed perception AI for Maxar Defence satelite views).
- **2019-21:** MSc + Open-source activities (JAX/NanoDl, Torch/SuperLazyAutograd, CUDARepo, etc.).
- **2018-19:** Google GADS Scholarship Programme with Andela (pre-MSc), around systems design.
- **2017-18:** National Youth service, posted to software engineering after bootcamp, mostly ARM. 
- **2012-16:** Started uni at 15y, covered EECS, data structures, algorithms, maths, physics.

### Fun Highlights 
- Wrote [Math + CS + AI (with codes)](https://github.com/HenryNdubuaku/maths-computing-ai).
- Gave [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/live/GJYpAl8pHmI?si=t4CTT9ndeu4EKItc) to a small ML group in Nigeria, on optimising large-scale ML in JAX.
- Co-host [this monthly dinner](https://lu.ma/ldnnexus) for AI researchers, engineers and founders in London. 
- Kevin Murphy (DeepMind Principal), Thomas Wolf (HuggingFace Co-foubder), Daniel Holtz (Mid Journey Founder), Steve Messina (IBM CTO) followed back on X.
- After CUDARepo, Nvidia reached out, I did 7 technical rounds, got a verbal offer, back-and-forth over YOE/pay, then I got YC.
- Did MSc at QMUL, just to work with Prof Matt Purver (Ex-Stanford Researcher on CALO), did my project/thesis with his team.
- Did BEng under Prof Onyema Uzoamaka (Rumoured first Nigerian CS grad from MIT), he taught computing archs off-head! 

### 2026 Wishlist

- Publish Cactus Paper -> 10m devices, $3m MRR, $1B clean valuatiuon. 
- Finish ongoing potentially groundbreaking research & Apply to PhD by publication.
